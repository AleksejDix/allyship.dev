# Will the European Accessibility Act Impact My Business?

## What Is the European Accessibility Act (EAA)?

Imagine you’re running a business. Everything seems fine, your products are selling, customers are happy. But then, BAM! The European Accessibility Act (EAA) lands, and you hear you might need to change the way you do things. What does that mean? More costs? More rules? More complexity? Let’s break it down.

The **EAA** is a European law designed to make sure products and services are accessible to people with disabilities. It applies to both digital and physical products, covering everything from websites to ATMs. The goal? A more inclusive world where accessibility is a right, not an afterthought.

## Who Needs to Pay Attention?

If your business operates in the EU and offers digital products, financial services, e-commerce, or transport services, this law **applies to you**. Here’s who needs to take note:

- **E-commerce businesses**: Your website, checkout process, and customer support must be accessible.
- **Banks & Financial Services**: Online banking platforms must work for all users.
- **Software & Hardware Providers**: ATMs, operating systems, and self-service kiosks need accessible interfaces.
- **Public Transport & Ticketing Services**: Online ticket booking must be user-friendly for those with disabilities.
- **Third-party vendors & agencies**: If you supply a service to a larger company affected by the EAA, you need to be compliant too.

And guess what? Even if your business is **outside the EU**, you may still need to comply if you serve European customers.

## What Features & Services Are Affected?

The EAA isn’t just some general guideline—it applies to specific parts of your business. If your business includes any of the following, you’ll need to meet accessibility standards:

### **E-Commerce & Online Services**
- **Online shopping & checkout processes**
- **Loyalty programs**
- **Account creation & logins**
- **Subscription models**
- **Customer support (live chat, help centers, etc.)**
- **Returns, refunds & tracking systems**

### **Sales Funnels & Aggregators**
- **Comparison sites (e.g., ticket aggregators, flight search tools)**
- **Any system that helps users make purchasing decisions**

### **E-Learning Platforms**
- **Online teaching tools**
- **Collaboration & communication tools**
- **Authoring tools & content management systems (CMS)**

### **Hardware & Self-Service Machines**
- **ATMs & kiosks**
- **Smart ticketing machines**
- **Public self-service terminals**

### **TV & Media Streaming Services**
- **Pre-installed apps (Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, etc.)**
- **Smart TV user interfaces**

If you **build, sell, or manage any of these things**, your business is affected.

## Does It Apply to Existing Features or Just New Ones?

Good question! The EAA applies to **new** products and services released after the enforcement date **(June 28, 2025)**. However, if you’re still selling an older product or maintaining an existing platform, you may **still need to retrofit it** to meet accessibility standards.

So no, you can’t just leave old features untouched. If they’re still in use, they need to comply.

## What Happens If You Ignore It?

Let’s say you decide not to bother with compliance. What’s the worst that could happen? Well, here’s what:

1. **Fines & Legal Trouble** – Non-compliance can lead to penalties. Every EU country will enforce these rules, and they don’t take accessibility lightly.
2. **Loss of Business** – If your competitors make their services accessible and you don’t, guess where customers will go?
3. **Public Relations Disaster** – Accessibility lawsuits and negative press can damage your brand reputation.

Ignoring accessibility isn’t just risky—it’s **bad business**.

## How to Prepare for the EAA

The good news? You don’t have to panic. Here’s a step-by-step plan:

### **1. Audit Your Digital & Physical Presence**
- Use tools like [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) or WAVE to test for accessibility issues.
- Ensure your website meets **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards.
- Check if your physical products meet usability requirements.

### **2. Train Your Team**
- Developers need to learn accessibility best practices.
- Designers should ensure content is readable and navigable.
- Customer support teams must be trained to assist all users effectively.

### **3. Improve Your Products & Services**
- **Ensure perceivable content** – Add captions, alt text, and readable fonts.
- **Make navigation easy** – Users should move through your website smoothly using a keyboard or screen reader.
- **Test with real users** – Conduct usability tests with people who use assistive technologies.

### **4. Work with Accessibility Experts**
- Hire certified consultants to perform audits.
- Get real-world feedback from people with disabilities.

### **5. Monitor & Stay Compliant**
- Accessibility isn’t a “one and done” thing—it’s **ongoing**.
- Set up periodic audits and keep up with legal updates.

## When Does the EAA Take Effect?

- **June 28, 2022** – EU countries had to start implementing the EAA.
- **June 28, 2025** – Businesses must be fully compliant.
- **June 28, 2030** – A grace period for certain sectors ends.

This means you have a **short window** to make your products and services compliant. Start now!

## Final Thoughts

The **European Accessibility Act is not just another rule—it’s a game-changer**. It’s about making the world more inclusive and ensuring that **everyone** can access your products and services.

> “You must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool.” – Richard Feynman

Don’t fool yourself into thinking accessibility is just another checkbox. It’s an opportunity to reach more customers, improve your user experience, and stay ahead of the competition.

So what’s the plan? Are you ready to make your business accessible, or will you wait until it’s too late?
