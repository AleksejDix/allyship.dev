# Accessibility Consultants: Primary Customer Group Analysis

## Market Overview: Small Accessibility Consultancies

Small accessibility consultancy firms (1-20 employees) represent a significant opportunity for AllyShip and AllyStudio. These companies provide accessibility audits, remediation services, and training to larger organizations that lack in-house expertise. They face unique challenges:

- **Manual Process Burden**: Spend 70-80% of billable hours on manual testing that could be automated
- **Limited Tool Access**: Cannot afford enterprise-level tools despite daily tool usage
- **Project-Based Workflow**: Need to efficiently audit multiple clients and projects simultaneously
- **Value Demonstration**: Struggle to quantify their impact to justify fees to clients
- **Competitive Pressure**: Competing against both freelancers and large consulting firms

According to WebAIM's 2023 survey, approximately 2,500 small accessibility consultancies operate in North America and Europe, collectively serving over 38,000 organizations per year.
