# Allyship Product Vision (2025-2027)

## Vision Statement

**"Sustainable Accessibility for a Sustainable Business"**

Our goal is to **make accessibility easy and practical** while ensuring that Allyship.dev and AllyStudio can support a full-time business. We focus on providing **high-value, real-world accessibility solutions** that companies will pay for—helping businesses become more inclusive while allowing continuous growth of the product.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Simplicity First** – Accessibility should fit into existing workflows without extra effort.
2. **Actionable Fixes Over Reports** – Helping users solve problems, not just find them.
3. **Integration-Driven** – Accessibility should be part of **design & development tools** (Figma, GitHub, etc.).
4. **Long-Term Sustainability** – The product should generate enough revenue to support full-time work.
5. **AI for Accessibility, Not Automation** – AI **assists users**, but doesn't replace expertise.

## Core Markets & Focus

### Primary Markets
- **Mid-Market Companies**: Organizations with compliance needs but limited accessibility resources
- **Digital Agencies**: Teams building websites for multiple clients who need efficient accessibility workflows
- **Sectors with Compliance Urgency**: Financial services, healthcare, education, and e-commerce

### Strategic Integrations

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Business Sustainability
- **Risk**: Insufficient revenue to support full-time work
- **Mitigation**: Focus on high-value, monetizable features first; establish recurring revenue model early

### Competitive Threats
- **Risk**: Major players (Adobe, Microsoft) enter accessibility space
- **Mitigation**: Focus on specialized features these platforms won't prioritize; build deeper integrations

### Technical Limitations
- **Risk**: Authenticated scanning poses technical challenges
- **Mitigation**: Start with fundamental scanning capabilities, then gradually expand coverage

### Pricing Strategy
- **Risk**: Pricing too high limits adoption; too low limits sustainability
- **Mitigation**: Tiered approach with clear value differentiation; usage-based components for enterprise

## Key Differentiators

1. **Real Business Value**: Solutions that directly save companies time and money
2. **Authenticated Page Testing**: Unique ability to scan secure content inaccessible to other tools
3. **Integration-First Approach**: Native experience within designer and developer workflows
4. **Actionable Guidance**: Clear, implementable fixes rather than just issue detection
5. **Fair Pricing**: Value-based pricing that aligns with the benefits delivered

## Success Metrics

- **Full-Time Workability**: The business generates enough revenue to replace other work
- **Recurring Revenue Growth**: A predictable, sustainable income stream with 30%+ annual growth
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Low churn rate (<5%) and high NPS (>50)
- **Time-Saving for Users**: Features actually help developers/designers work 25%+ faster
- **Conversion Rate**: Free-to-paid conversion rate exceeds 5%

## Validation Checkpoints

- **Q2 2025**: First 10 paying customers with validated willingness to pay
- **Q4 2025**: Positive unit economics (LTV > 3x CAC)
- **Q2 2026**: Monthly recurring revenue reaches minimum viability threshold
- **Q4 2026**: Customer retention exceeds 80% annually
- **Q2 2027**: Business generates sustainable full-time income

This vision will be reviewed quarterly with a focus on unit economics, customer feedback, and progress toward full-time viability.
