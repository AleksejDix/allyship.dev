# Allyship.dev & AllyStudio Marketing Plan
> Maximum 2 hours per week time investment

## Executive Summary

This marketing plan outlines a focused strategy for promoting two complementary accessibility products:

1. **Allyship.dev** - A dashboard platform for automated accessibility monitoring that:
   - Runs scheduled axe-core scans on websites
