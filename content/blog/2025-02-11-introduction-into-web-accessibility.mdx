# Introduction to Web Accessibility

> "Web accessibility isn't just about disabled users being able to access your website — it's about everyone being able to access your website." - Trenton Moss

This powerful statement tells a fundamental truth about web accessibility that many developers and designers overlook. Let's explore why accessibility is truly universal by diving into the basics.

## What Is Web Accessibility?

Web accessibility (or abbreviation **a11y**) is the practice of designing and developing websites that are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. 

## Why Is Accessibility Important?

When we design for accessibility, we're actually designing for all possible situations in which users might access our content:

- blind or visually impaired user using a screen reader due to visual impairment
- A user with temporary limited mobility using keyboard navigation
- A person in a noisy environment reading captions
- Someone with slow internet connection requiring optimized images
- A user accessing content on a small mobile screen

## Why Accessibility is a Necessity, Not an Option!

1. **Inclusivity** – Around 15% of the global population has some form of disability. Making the web accessible means ensuring that no one is left behind.
2. **Legal Compliance** – Many countries, including the EU (European Accessibility Act) and the US (ADA, Section 508), require businesses to meet accessibility standards.
3. **Better User Experience** – Accessible design often leads to better usability for all users, including those without disabilities.
4. **SEO Benefits** – Search engines favor accessible websites, as they tend to have better structure and semantic content.

## Key Web Accessibility Standards

The most widely recognized standard for web accessibility is the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**. WCAG is based on four key principles:

- **Perceivable** – Information should be presented in ways that users can perceive (e.g., adding alt text for images).
- **Operable** – Users must be able to navigate the site using different input methods (keyboard, screen readers, etc.).
- **Understandable** – Content should be clear and predictable.
- **Robust** – Websites should work with various assistive technologies.

## Common Accessibility Issues & Fixes

### Missing Alternative Text (Alt Text) for Images or Adding Indescriptible Alternative Text
**Problem:** Screen readers cannot interpret images without alt text, and indescriptible alt text (e.g., `alt="image"`) does not help users understand the content.

**Fix:** Always include meaningful `alt` attributes for images. If the image is purely decorative, use an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`) to signal that it should be ignored by screen readers.

```html
<!-- Bad Example-->
<img src="image.jpg" alt="image" /> <!-- Indescriptible alt text -->

<!-- Another Bad Example -->
<img src="image.jpg" /> <!-- Missing alt attribute entirely -->

<!-- Good Example-->
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A person using a laptop" />

<!-- Good for decorative images -->
<img src="image.jpg" alt="" />
```

### Insufficient Color Contrast
**Problem:** Low contrast makes text hard to read for visually impaired users.

**Fix:** Use tools like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to ensure a minimum contrast ratio of **4.5:1** for normal text.

```html
<!-- Bad Example -->
<p style="color: #ccc; background-color: #eee;">This text has low contrast and is hard to read.</p>

<!-- Good Example -->
<p style="color: #000; background-color: #fff;">This text has good contrast and is easy to read.</p>
```

### Missing ARIA Attributes
**Problem:** Dynamic content (modals, dropdowns) may not be detected by screen readers.

**Fix:** Use ARIA roles and attributes correctly.
```html
<!-- Bad Example -->
<button>Open Menu</button> <!-- No ARIA attributes to indicate menu state -->

<!-- Good Example -->
<button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="menu">Open Menu</button>
```

### Improper Use of Heading Structure
**Problem:** Skipping heading levels (e.g., jumping from `<h1>` to `<h3>`) or using headings for styling rather than structure can make content difficult to navigate for screen readers.

**Fix:** Use a logical heading order (`<h1>` → `<h2>` → `<h3>`), and avoid using headings just for visual styling.

```html
<!-- Bad Example -->
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h3>Smaller Section</h3> <!-- Skipping heading level from <h1> to <h3> -->

<!-- Good Example -->
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<h3>Smaller Section</h3>
```

## Non-Descriptive Link Text

**Problem:** Generic link text like "Click here" or "Read more" does not provide context for screen reader users.

**Fix:** Use meaningful, descriptive link text.

```html
<!-- Bad Example -->
<a href="report.pdf">Click here</a>

<!-- Good Example -->
<a href="report.pdf">Download the accessibility report (PDF)</a>
```

## Lack of Form Accessibility

**Problem:** Forms without proper labels and associations are hard to use for assistive technologies.

**Fix:** Use `<label>` elements and associate them with inputs using `for` or `aria-labelledby`.

```html
<!-- Bad Example-->
<input type="email" id="email" name="email" required /> <!-- Missing label -->

<!-- Good Example -->
<label for="email">Email:</label>
<input type="email" id="email" name="email" required />
```

For radio buttons and checkboxes, wrap them with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`.

```html
<!-- Bad Example-->
<input type="radio" name="color" value="red"> Red
<input type="radio" name="color" value="blue"> Blue

<!-- Good Example-->
<fieldset>
  <legend>Choose your favorite color:</legend>
  <label><input type="radio" name="color" value="red"> Red</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="color" value="blue"> Blue</label>
</fieldset>
```
