# Verification and Validation: What’s the Difference?

Imagine this: You’re designing a bicycle. You build it, check that all the specifications match—two wheels, handlebars, pedals. It’s perfect! But wait, you forgot to consider that the target user is a 3-year-old. A two-wheeled bike won’t work for them—they need a tricycle. This is the difference between **verification** and **validation**, and it’s a fundamental concept in software testing and development.

In this blog post, we’ll break it down simply, with examples to make these terms crystal clear. We’ll also explore how **WCAG** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) ties into these processes to ensure accessibility for all users.

## What Is Verification?

**Verification** is about checking that a product meets the requirements and specifications. It answers the question: **"Are we building the product right?"**

This process focuses on:
- Ensuring all specified requirements are implemented.
- Confirming that the product behaves as expected according to design documents.
- Checking functionality without necessarily considering the end user’s experience.

### Example:
You’re tasked with testing a television. The requirements specify:
- Screen size: 55 inches.
- Ability to connect to HDMI devices.
- Built-in support for YouTube.

During verification, you ensure:
1. The TV screen measures exactly 55 inches.
2. HDMI devices connect successfully.
3. YouTube opens and streams content without issues.

If all of this works as intended, the product passes verification.

## What Is Validation?

**Validation** ensures that the product meets the needs of the end user. It answers the question: **"Are we building the right product?"**

While verification focuses on technical correctness, validation looks at usability, functionality, and whether the product solves the user’s problems.

### Example:
Let’s go back to the television. Imagine the TV is technically perfect, but you discover:
- The remote control is too complicated for users.
- The YouTube app has a confusing interface.
- A common target audience uses streaming services that aren’t supported.

In validation, you test whether the TV provides a good experience for the user and fulfills their expectations.

## Key Differences Between Verification and Validation

| **Aspect**            | **Verification**                                              | **Validation**                                              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**             | Meeting specifications and requirements.                     | Meeting the needs of the user.                             |
| **Question Answered** | "Are we building the product right?"                         | "Are we building the right product?"                      |
| **Timing**            | Early in the development lifecycle (e.g., design phase).     | Later stages, involving real-world testing and feedback.   |
| **Examples**          | Code reviews, design document checks, static analysis.       | Usability testing, user feedback, real-world use cases.    |

## Dynamic and Static Testing

Sometimes people think verification is always static (no code execution) and validation is dynamic (code execution). While this is often true, it’s not a strict rule.

- **Static Verification**: Reviewing documents, inspecting code, or conducting walkthroughs without running the program.
- **Dynamic Verification**: Running tests to ensure the product functions correctly.

Similarly, validation can include both:
- Static validation: Reviewing requirements to ensure user needs are addressed.
- Dynamic validation: Testing the product with real users or realistic scenarios.

## Incorporating WCAG into Verification and Validation

When it comes to web development, ensuring accessibility is critical. This is where **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)** plays a role in both verification and validation.

### WCAG in Verification
In the verification stage, WCAG helps ensure that your website meets accessibility standards by checking against specific criteria, such as:
- Providing text alternatives for non-text content (**WCAG 1.1.1**).
- Ensuring sufficient color contrast between text and background (**WCAG 1.4.3**).
- Structuring content with semantic HTML elements to support assistive technologies (**WCAG 1.3.1**).

### WCAG in Validation
Validation focuses on real-world usability. Here, WCAG helps confirm that:
- Screen readers can effectively navigate and interpret the website.
- Keyboard-only navigation is seamless and intuitive.
- Users with disabilities can perform essential tasks without barriers, such as filling out forms or making purchases.

For example, during validation, you might test your site with actual users who rely on assistive technologies to ensure that the design and functionality meet their needs.

## Why Both Matter

Skipping verification can lead to a product that doesn’t meet the basic requirements. Skipping validation can result in a product that technically works but fails to satisfy users.

### Example: Subscription Plans
Imagine offering a subscription bundle with three services. Verification ensures the bundle applies the discount correctly. Validation, however, might reveal that users only want one service and find the bundle irrelevant.

By integrating WCAG into both verification and validation, you ensure that your product is not only functional but also accessible and inclusive.

## A Simple Recap

- **Verification**: Ensures the product is built correctly, meeting requirements and specifications.
- **Validation**: Confirms the product meets user needs and provides value.
- **WCAG**: Helps ensure the product is accessible to all users, addressing both technical and usability aspects.

### Key Questions:
1. **Verification:** Are we meeting the client’s specifications?
2. **Validation:** Are we solving the user’s problem?
3. **Accessibility:** Can all users, regardless of ability, interact with the product effectively?

## Closing Thoughts

Understanding verification, validation, and WCAG is vital for software testing and development. While they often overlap in practice, knowing their distinctions ensures you’re building a product that works *and* delights users while being accessible to everyone.

Remember, great testing isn’t just about ticking off requirements. It’s about creating solutions that people love to use—and can use.
