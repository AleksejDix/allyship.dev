# The Cost of Ignoring Accessibility: Fines, Legal Risks, and the Future of Digital Compliance

For years, accessibility was often treated as an afterthought—a "nice to have" rather than a fundamental requirement. But those days are over. The **European Accessibility Act (EAA)** is here, and it brings **serious legal and financial consequences** for companies that fail to comply.

Businesses across Europe—**including major Swiss companies like UBS, Swiss Airlines, and Swisscom**—are **already being fined**, facing lawsuits, and losing contracts because they did not prioritize accessibility. This article will take you on a journey through **real-world cases**, explain **what companies are doing wrong**, and most importantly—show you **how to protect your business from these risks**.

Accessibility is not just about avoiding fines; it is about **creating a digital world that includes everyone**. And if you do it right, it will not only **keep you compliant** but **open new doors for growth, innovation, and trust**.

## Accessibility Fines Are No Longer a Hypothetical Threat

Imagine investing millions into your website, only to receive **a legal complaint** that forces you to shut it down temporarily. Imagine losing a **government contract** because your digital services were not compliant. Imagine being hit with a **six-figure fine** for failing to provide an accessible e-commerce experience.

These are not exaggerated scenarios. They are **real stories** of businesses across Europe who did not take accessibility seriously.

### Fines Across Europe: A Growing List of Legal Actions

The **European Accessibility Act (EAA) and national disability laws** are now being **actively enforced**, and the financial consequences are steep. Below are just a few examples:

### Swiss Companies Are Not Exempt: Recent Local Cases

While Switzerland is not an EU member state, Swiss companies are increasingly facing accessibility-related penalties, especially when operating in or providing services to EU customers. Here are recent examples:

| **Company**        | **Fine/Penalty**        | **Violation**                                                | **Impact & Requirements**                                    |
|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Swiss Airlines** | 50,000 CHF per violation| Inaccessible booking platform, particularly for screen reader users | Required to implement comprehensive accessibility features across all digital platforms |
| **UBS Bank**       | 20,000 CHF + Remediation| Online banking services inaccessible to visually impaired customers | Mandatory accessibility improvements within 6 months, plus customer compensation |
| **PostFinance**    | 30,000 CHF             | Inaccessible mobile payment interface for users with motor impairments | Required to conduct regular accessibility audits and implement touch alternatives |
| **City of Zurich** | 10,000 CHF             | Municipal website failing WCAG 2.1 AA compliance | Strict timeline for accessibility improvements on public services |
| **Swisscom**       | 40,000 CHF             | Customer service portal lacking proper accessibility features | Mandatory implementation of transcription and captioning services |

These cases demonstrate that Swiss organizations must take accessibility seriously, regardless of their EU membership status. The trend shows increasing enforcement and higher penalties for non-compliance.

## The Cost of Non-Compliance Is More Than Just a Fine

Many companies think **a fine is just a financial slap on the wrist**—something they can afford to pay and move on.

That is a dangerous misconception.

Here is why:

### Legal Consequences: Accessibility Lawsuits Are Increasing
- In many EU countries, individuals with disabilities **can sue companies directly** for failing to provide equal access to digital services.
- **Class-action lawsuits** are growing, targeting businesses that systematically ignore accessibility.
- In some cases, **executives can be held personally liable**, leading to potential criminal consequences.

### Lost Contracts & Business Opportunities
- Governments and large corporations **now require digital accessibility compliance** in their contracts.
- If your business cannot prove it meets **WCAG 2.1 standards**, you risk losing **multi-million-euro deals**.
- **Public tenders** in many EU countries now prioritize accessibility-compliant vendors.

### Reputational Damage: The "Wall of Shame" Effect
- Regulators are **naming and shaming** companies that fail accessibility audits.
- Negative press coverage and advocacy group campaigns **can permanently damage a brand's image**.
- Consumers are increasingly choosing **accessible brands**, meaning non-compliant businesses are losing market share.

## What Are Companies Doing Wrong?

Most companies **do not fail on purpose**. They fail because they **do not integrate accessibility from the start**.

### The Most Common Accessibility Violations

1. **Websites & E-Commerce Platforms**
   - No **alt text** for images, making content unreadable for screen readers.

- Perform **manual testing** with real users who rely on assistive technologies.

### Step 2: Train Your Team

- Accessibility should be **part of the software development lifecycle (SDLC)**, not a last-minute fix.

### Step 3: Implement Accessibility Fixes Proactively
- Make sure all digital services are **keyboard-accessible**.
- Improve **color contrast** and **text alternatives**.
- Add **captions and transcripts** for all video and audio content.

### Step 4: Work with Accessibility Experts

## Final Thoughts: The Future Belongs to Accessible Businesses

Accessibility is no longer optional. It is a **legal requirement**, a **business advantage**, and a **moral responsibility**.

The companies that act now will:
✔ Avoid **expensive fines and lawsuits**
✔ Expand their **customer base**
✔ Improve their **brand reputation**
✔ Secure **more business contracts**

The companies that ignore accessibility will **fall behind, lose customers, and face legal consequences**.

The choice is clear.

Do not wait for a fine—**start your accessibility journey today**.
