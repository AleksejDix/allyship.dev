# Why Swiss Companies Should Care About the European Accessibility Act (EAA)

## The Silent Shift in Digital Business – Are You Ready?

Swiss companies have long been known for their **precision, quality, and reliability**. But now, a quiet regulatory shift in the European Union is bringing accessibility into focus. The **European Accessibility Act (EAA) [(Directive 2019/882)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882)** will transform the way businesses operate digitally—and **Swiss companies are not exempt**.

Switzerland may not be an EU member state, but if you sell **digital products, services, or software to EU customers**, or if you have contracts with EU-based businesses, **you must comply**.

Ignoring this regulation could mean:
- **Lost contracts with EU clients** who require accessibility compliance
- **Being unable to sell to EU customers** due to non-compliant websites or platforms
- **Legal risks and potential fines** for failing to meet EU standards

Let's break down what this means for Swiss companies and how to stay ahead of the game.

## What is the European Accessibility Act?

The **EAA is an EU-wide law requiring digital and physical products to be accessible to people with disabilities**. It applies to industries ranging from **e-commerce and banking to transport, software, and telecommunications**.

From **June 28, 2025**, businesses must ensure their products and services comply with the accessibility standards outlined in **[WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)**.

### Who Must Comply?

If your business:
- **Sells products or services in the EU (including online stores and SaaS platforms)**
- **Works with EU-based businesses as a B2B vendor, supplier, or partner**
- **Provides software, digital platforms, or financial services used by EU consumers**
- **Develops mobile apps or self-service kiosks for international clients**

Then you **must** comply with the EAA, even if your company is based in Switzerland.

## What Happens If You Ignore Compliance?

Swiss companies that fail to meet the EAA's accessibility requirements may face serious consequences, including:

### 1. Losing EU Business Contracts
Many **EU corporations are updating their procurement policies** to ensure **all vendors, suppliers, and partners meet accessibility requirements**.

If your platform, product, or service is **not accessible**, you may find yourself excluded from **major EU contracts**.

### 2. Being Blocked from Selling in the EU
The EAA is not just about improving accessibility—it is about **enforcing compliance**. If your website, SaaS platform, or mobile app does not meet **[WCAG 2.1 AA standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)**, you could be prevented from selling in the EU market.

### 3. Facing Legal Risks & Fines
The **EAA introduces penalties for non-compliance**, and fines may vary by country. EU member states are responsible for setting enforcement mechanisms, but **businesses that fail to comply risk financial penalties, potential lawsuits, and reputational damage**.

For example, under similar laws like the **EU Web Accessibility Directive**, fines can range from **€5,000 to €100,000 per violation** depending on the severity of the breach. The EAA is expected to **follow a similar model**, making non-compliance a **significant financial risk**.

### 4. Competitive Disadvantage
Companies that prioritize accessibility will **gain a competitive edge** by expanding their market reach, improving user experience, and strengthening their reputation. Those who delay will fall behind.

## What Will Be Affected?

### E-Commerce & Online Platforms
- Product pages, checkout processes, **loyalty programs, customer support, and subscription services** must be accessible
- Package tracking systems and return policies must accommodate users with disabilities

### Software & SaaS Providers
- Swiss **SaaS companies must ensure their UI, onboarding flows, and core functionality** are accessible
- Screen readers, keyboard navigation, and alternative text for images are essential

### Banking & Financial Services
- **Online banking, payment gateways, financial apps, and ATMs** must be accessible
- Transactions must support users with disabilities through voice navigation or keyboard-friendly interfaces

### B2B Contracts & Supply Chain
- Swiss **consulting firms, agencies, and IT services** working with EU clients must ensure **contractual compliance with accessibility requirements**
- Accessibility audits may become a standard part of vendor selection processes

### Telecommunications & Streaming Services
- **Video content, digital media, and online communication platforms** must include captions, transcripts, and assistive technology support

## What Swiss Companies Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Audit Your Digital Accessibility
Conduct an **accessibility audit** on your website, apps, and digital services. Use **tools like [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) and WAVE** to check compliance with **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards.

### Step 2: Identify Accessibility Gaps
Many companies assume they are compliant until they perform their first **accessibility test**. Common problems include:
- Poor keyboard navigation
- Low contrast making text unreadable
- Forms without proper labels
- Videos without captions or transcripts
- Missing **alternative text** for images

### Step 3: Fix Non-Compliant Features
Ensure:
- **Websites and apps** follow WCAG standards
- **E-commerce checkout pages** are screen-reader-friendly
- **B2B platforms** meet EU procurement requirements

### Step 4: Train Your Team
- Educate **developers, designers, and product managers** on accessibility best practices
- Provide training on **inclusive design and assistive technologies**

### Step 5: Update Contracts & Business Agreements
- If you work with EU companies, **expect accessibility clauses in your contracts**
- Review legal agreements to ensure compliance

### Step 6: Implement Accessibility Monitoring
- Accessibility is **not a one-time fix**—it requires **ongoing improvements and testing**
- Regularly update **content, software, and interfaces** to maintain compliance

## The Business Case for Accessibility

Accessibility is not just about **avoiding fines**—it is about **future-proofing your business**.

By investing in accessibility now, you:
- Improve **user experience for all customers**
- Reduce **legal and compliance risks**
- Open **new market opportunities** with EU-based companies
- Strengthen your company's **reputation for innovation and inclusivity**

Companies that **treat accessibility as a strategic advantage** will **gain customer trust, secure contracts, and stand out in a highly competitive market**.

## Final Thoughts: Take Action Before It's Too Late

The **European Accessibility Act is not a distant regulation**—it is a reality that will **reshape how businesses operate in the EU**.

Swiss companies have two options:
1. **Prepare now and gain a competitive edge**
2. **Wait until compliance becomes an urgent (and costly) problem**

Allyship helps businesses **navigate accessibility compliance with expertise, audits, and strategic planning**. **Let's make accessibility an opportunity—not an obstacle**.
