# Plasmo Extension Architecture

## Structure Overview

The AllyStudio extension is structured into several key areas, each with a specific responsibility:

- **Background Scripts** (`src/background/`): Non-UI logic that runs in the background of the browser
- **Content Scripts** (`src/contents/`): Scripts that execute in the context of web pages
- **Popup UI** (`src/popup.tsx`): The UI that appears when clicking the extension icon
- **Options Page** (`src/options/`): Extension settings page
- **Side Panel** (`src/sidepanel/`): UI that appears in the browser's side panel
- **UI Components** (`src/components/`): Reusable UI components

## Directory Organization

```

├── components/     # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/         # Basic UI components (shadcn/ui based)
│   └── ...         # Feature-specific components
├── contents/       # Content scripts

├── styles/         # Global styles
├── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/          # Utility functions
```

## Component Lifecycle

Each part of the extension has a specific lifecycle:

1. **Background Scripts**: Run constantly in the background, even when the extension UI is closed
2. **Content Scripts**: Injected into web pages when they match the specified patterns
3. **Popup UI**: Activated when the user clicks the extension icon in the toolbar
4. **Options Page**: Opened when the user accesses the extension settings
5. **Side Panel**: Available in the browser's side panel when enabled

Understanding these lifecycles is crucial for developing features that work across the different components of the extension.
