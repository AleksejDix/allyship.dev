# AllyStudio Overview & Purpose

## Introduction

AllyStudio is built as a browser extension using the Plasmo framework, which provides a modern development experience for creating browser extensions with React. This guide explains the purpose and vision behind the extension.

## Purpose & Vision

AllyStudio is a powerful accessibility auditing tool designed to help developers, designers, and content creators identify and fix accessibility issues on their websites. The extension offers:

- **Real-time Accessibility Analysis**: Scan web pages as you browse to detect WCAG compliance issues
- **Element Inspection**: Examine individual elements for accessibility problems
- **Focus Order Visualization**: Trace keyboard navigation paths through the page
- **Space & Website Management**: Organize accessibility efforts across teams and projects
- **Actionable Remediation**: Generate clear guidance on how to fix detected issues

We're building AllyStudio to democratize web accessibility, making it easier for everyone to create inclusive digital experiences. The goal is to lower the barrier to accessibility knowledge and implementation by providing:

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Developers get instant results while working
2. **Educational Tools**: Learning opportunities embedded within the testing process
3. **Collaborative Workflows**: Teams can track progress across websites
4. **Actionable Solutions**: Clear guidance on making meaningful improvements

By creating a browser extension, we provide a seamless workflow integration that doesn't require developers to leave their development environment or use external services to test accessibility.
