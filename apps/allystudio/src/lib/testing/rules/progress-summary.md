# Accessibility Testing Progress Summary

## Recent Accomplishments (Last Sprint)

We've made significant progress on the technical foundations of our accessibility testing framework:

### 1. Enhanced Element Highlighting System

- ‚úÖ Added visual feedback with pulsing animations for highlighted elements
- ‚úÖ Fixed layer management to properly clear previous highlights
- ‚úÖ Implemented multiple redundant methods for element discovery and scrolling:
  - CSS selector lookup
  - XPath evaluation
  - ID-based lookups
  - Multiple scrolling approaches for cross-browser compatibility
- ‚úÖ Improved visualization with persistent message display

### 2. Improved Selector Generation

- ‚úÖ Replaced `getCssSelector` with more robust `getValidSelector` function
- ‚úÖ Updated all rule files to use the improved selector function
- ‚úÖ Added support for elements with special characters in IDs
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling for invalid selectors

### 3. Code Quality and Documentation

- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive debug logging for easier troubleshooting
- ‚úÖ Updated documentation to reflect current implementation status
- ‚úÖ Created README with overview of our accessibility testing approach
- ‚úÖ Standardized code structure across rule implementations

## Current Work (Current Sprint)

We're focusing on completing the foundation for robust accessibility testing:

### 1. Form Accessibility Rules

- üîÑ Finalizing form label association checks (WCAG 3.3.2, 4.1.2)
- üîÑ Implementing input purpose identification (WCAG 1.3.5)
- üîÑ Adding form error identification tests (WCAG 3.3.1, 3.3.3)

### 2. HTML Structure and Parsing Rules

- üîÑ Building HTML validation for duplicate IDs and proper nesting
- üîÑ Developing parsing error detection for malformed HTML elements

### 3. Test Coverage and Validation

- üîÑ Creating automated tests for existing rules
- üîÑ Validating rules against known accessibility issues

## Upcoming Work (Next Sprint)

Our next focus areas will be:

### 1. Color and Contrast Rules

- ‚è≥ Text contrast ratio validation (WCAG 1.4.3)
- ‚è≥ UI component contrast checks (WCAG 1.4.11)
- ‚è≥ Color-only information detection (WCAG 1.4.1)

### 2. ARIA Implementation Rules

- ‚è≥ ARIA landmark usage validation
- ‚è≥ ARIA role validity checks
- ‚è≥ ARIA state and property validation

### 3. User Experience Improvements

- ‚è≥ Enhancing result display and filtering
- ‚è≥ Improving remediation guidance
- ‚è≥ Adding support for saving and comparing test results

## Challenges and Solutions

### Selector Generation and Element Finding

**Challenge**: Generating reliable CSS selectors that work across different browser contexts, especially for elements with special characters or complex structures.

**Solution**: Implemented a multi-strategy approach in `getValidSelector()` that falls back to different selector generation methods, with built-in validation to ensure selectors reliably find the intended elements.

### Highlight Management

**Challenge**: Managing multiple highlight layers with different purposes (test results, focus highlights, inspector) while ensuring good performance.

**Solution**: Implemented a layered architecture with optimized rendering paths for different highlight types (fast path for inspector highlights, debounced updates for test results, immediate updates for focus highlights).

### Browser Extension Context

**Challenge**: Reliable communication between the extension popup and content script contexts, especially for highlighting elements.

**Solution**: Implemented multiple redundant communication channels (event bus, direct messaging) with detailed logging and graceful fallbacks.

## Metrics and Progress

- **Rule Implementation**: 27/85 rules implemented (32%)
- **WCAG Coverage**: 14/50 success criteria covered (28%)
- **Critical Rules**: 7/25 critical priority rules implemented (28%)

We expect to reach 40% implementation by the end of the current sprint and 60% by the end of Q2.
