# Critical Priority Accessibility Rules - Implementation Progress

We are implementing critical priority accessibility rules as specified in the [Missing Rules TODOs](./missing-rules-todos.md) document. This document tracks our progress on these critical implementations.

## Form Accessibility Rules - Critical Priority

- [x] **Implement form label association checks (WCAG 3.3.2, 4.1.2)**

  - Created `formLabelAssociationRule` that checks if form controls have properly associated labels
  - Implemented detection for all labeling methods: explicit labels, implicit labels, aria-labelledby, aria-label
  - Added special handling for buttons and inputs with implicit labels via value attribute
  - Included detection of placeholder-only labels (which are insufficient for WCAG compliance)

- [ ] **Add input purpose identification validation (WCAG 1.3.5)**

  - Verify that form fields collecting user information use autocomplete attribute
  - Check for proper autocomplete values based on input purpose

- [ ] **Implement form error identification and suggestion tests (WCAG 3.3.1, 3.3.3)**

  - Detect proper error identification in forms
  - Check for clear error messages and suggestions

- [ ] **Add validation for form instructions (WCAG 3.3.2)**

  - Ensure forms provide clear instructions
  - Validate that required fields are clearly indicated

- [ ] **Implement keyboard accessibility for all form controls (WCAG 2.1.1)**
  - Check that all form controls can be operated via keyboard
  - Validate focus behavior and keyboard operability

## Color and Contrast Rules - Critical Priority

- [ ] **Implement text contrast ratio validation (WCAG 1.4.3)**

  - Calculate contrast ratio between text and background
  - Validate against WCAG requirements based on text size

- [ ] **Add UI component contrast checks (WCAG 1.4.11)**

  - Check contrast of UI controls and visual boundaries
  - Validate against minimum contrast requirements

- [ ] **Implement color-only information detection (WCAG 1.4.1)**

  - Detect when information is conveyed by color alone
  - Check for alternative indicators (text, patterns, etc.)

- [ ] **Add contrast for focus indicators (WCAG 1.4.11)**

  - Validate that focus indicators have sufficient contrast
  - Check visibility of focus states

- [ ] **Implement validation for text overlaid on background images (WCAG 1.4.3)**
  - Check contrast of text on image backgrounds
  - Validate readability against background variation

## HTML Structure and Parsing Rules - Critical Priority

- [ ] **Implement valid DOCTYPE declaration check**

  - Verify presence of valid DOCTYPE declaration
  - Check for HTML5 compliance

- [ ] **Add HTML validation (no duplicate IDs, proper element nesting)**

  - Check for duplicate IDs in the document
  - Validate proper nesting of elements

- [ ] **Implement parsing error detection (malformed HTML elements)**

  - Detect malformed HTML elements and syntax errors
  - Check for unclosed tags and other parsing issues

- [ ] **Add check for empty ID values**

  - Detect elements with empty ID attributes
  - Validate against proper ID usage

- [ ] **Implement validation for programmatically determined content structure**
  - Check that content structure can be programmatically determined
  - Validate semantic structure of content

## ARIA Implementation Rules - Critical Priority

- [ ] **Implement ARIA landmark usage validation**

  - Check for proper ARIA landmark usage
  - Validate landmark roles and structure

- [ ] **Add ARIA role validity checks**

  - Validate that ARIA roles are used correctly
  - Check for proper role values

- [ ] **Implement ARIA state and property validation**

  - Validate ARIA states and properties
  - Check for required attributes based on roles

- [ ] **Add ARIA relationship attribute validation**

  - Check ARIA relationship attributes
  - Validate proper referencing

- [ ] **Implement ARIA required attribute checks**

  - Check for required attributes based on ARIA roles
  - Validate completeness of ARIA implementation

- [ ] **Add validation for proper use of aria-hidden**

  - Check that aria-hidden is used correctly
  - Validate against improper hiding of focusable elements

- [ ] **Implement check for proper heading role usage**

  - Validate proper use of heading role
  - Check for semantic heading structure

- [ ] **Add validation of aria-label and aria-labelledby references**
  - Check that aria-labelledby references exist
  - Validate that aria-label provides meaningful text

## Implementation Plan

1. Complete all Form Accessibility Rules
2. Move to HTML Structure and Parsing Rules
3. Implement Color and Contrast Rules
4. Complete ARIA Implementation Rules

This implementation order follows the priority specified in the [Missing Rules TODOs](./missing-rules-todos.md) document while focusing on user impact.
