            <p>
              Article 8 of the European Accessibility Act defines the
              obligations of importers. Importers play a crucial role in the
              supply chain as they are the economic operators who place products
              from third countries onto the EU market.
            </p>
            <p>
              As gatekeepers between manufacturers outside the EU and the
              European market, importers have the responsibility to verify that
              products they import comply with the accessibility requirements
              before making them available on the market.
