            <p>
              Harmonized standards play a crucial role in the implementation of
              the European Accessibility Act (EAA). They provide technical means
              to meet the accessibility requirements and create a presumption of
              conformity, making it easier for economic operators to demonstrate
              compliance with the directive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Article 15 of the EAA establishes the framework for using
              harmonized standards and technical specifications to assess the
              conformity of products and services with the accessibility
              requirements set forth in the directive.

            Harmonized Standards
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p>
              Harmonized standards are European standards that have been
              developed by recognized European Standards Organizations (ESOs)
              such as CEN, CENELEC, or ETSI, following a standardization request
              from the European Commission.
            </p>
            <p>
              Under the EAA, products and services that comply with harmonized
              standards (or parts thereof), whose references have been published
              in the Official Journal of the European Union, benefit from a
              presumption of conformity with the accessibility requirements
              covered by those standards.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means that when a manufacturer or service provider applies a
              harmonized standard correctly, authorities must presume that the
              product or service complies with the accessibility requirements
              covered by that standard.

              Some important harmonized standards related to accessibility
              include:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">

          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p>
              In the absence of published harmonized standards, the EAA allows
              for the use of technical specifications to assess conformity with
              the accessibility requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Article 15 of the EAA, the Commission may adopt
              implementing acts establishing technical specifications that meet
              the accessibility requirements of the directive. These
              implementing acts are adopted in accordance with the examination
              procedure referred to in Article 27(2) of the EAA.
            </p>
            <p>
              Products and services that conform with these technical
              specifications, or parts thereof, are presumed to conform with the
              accessibility requirements of the EAA covered by those technical
              specifications.

              Development of Technical Specifications

            <p>
              Before adopting technical specifications, the Commission conducts

              representing persons with disabilities.

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>Presumption of Conformity:</strong> The most significant
                benefit is the legal presumption of conformity with the EAA
                requirements
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reduced Compliance Burden:</strong> Standards provide

                <strong>Market Recognition:</strong> Using recognized standards

              <li>
                <strong>Risk Reduction:</strong> Following standards reduces the

          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p>
              The EAA recognizes that harmonized standards may not always cover
              all aspects of the accessibility requirements. In such cases:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>
                The presumption of conformity applies only to those aspects
                covered by the harmonized standard
              </li>
              <li>
                For remaining aspects, economic operators must demonstrate
                compliance through other means
              </li>
              <li>
                A standard may be cited in the Official Journal with

              </li>
            </ul>

              This allows for flexibility while still promoting the use of
