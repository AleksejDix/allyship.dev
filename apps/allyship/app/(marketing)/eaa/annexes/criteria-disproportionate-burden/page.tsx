            <p>
              Annex VI of the European Accessibility Act (EAA) establishes
              specific criteria for assessing whether compliance with
              accessibility requirements would impose a disproportionate burden
              on economic operators. These criteria provide a structured
              framework for evaluating claims of disproportionate burden and
              ensuring consistent application across the EU.
            </p>
            <p>
              The criteria in this annex should be used in conjunction with the
              disproportionate burden assessment process outlined in Annex IV.
              While Annex IV provides the overall assessment methodology, Annex
              VI details the specific factors that should be considered during
              this assessment.

              The EAA specifies that the following criteria must be taken into

              Categories of Impact

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Low Impact:</strong> Products or services used
                infrequently or by small numbers of persons with disabilities,
                with many accessible alternatives
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              A higher impact category indicates a greater potential benefit to

              costs of implementation.

            <p>
              Microenterprises providing services are exempted from the
              requirement to perform the assessment of disproportionate burden.
              However, they must still comply with the applicable accessibility
              requirements.

              Definition of Microenterprise
            </h3>
            <p>
              A microenterprise is defined as an enterprise that employs fewer
              than 10 persons and has an annual turnover not exceeding ‚Ç¨2
              million or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding ‚Ç¨2 million.

            <p>
              While microenterprises providing services are exempt from the
              formal assessment requirements, they should note that:

            <ul>
              <li>
                They still must comply with the accessibility requirements of

              </li>
              <li>
                If they claim disproportionate burden, they should be prepared
                to justify this claim if requested by market surveillance
                authorities
              </li>
              <li>
                The exemption applies only to the formal assessment process, not
                to the accessibility requirements themselves

          <div className="prose max-w-none">
            <p>
              The criteria in Annex VI provide a structured framework for
              assessing whether compliance with accessibility requirements would
              impose a disproportionate burden. By considering the ratio of
              costs to overall costs and turnover, as well as the potential
              benefit to persons with disabilities based on frequency and
              duration of use, economic operators can make an informed
              assessment.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is important to note that claiming disproportionate burden is
              an exception rather than the rule. Economic operators should
              always aim to maximize accessibility within their constraints and
              should only claim disproportionate burden after a thorough and
              well-documented assessment process.
            </p>
            <p>
              The assessment should be periodically reviewed as technologies
              evolve, costs change, and new solutions become available, ensuring
              that accessibility continues to improve over time even when a
              disproportionate burden has been legitimately claimed.
