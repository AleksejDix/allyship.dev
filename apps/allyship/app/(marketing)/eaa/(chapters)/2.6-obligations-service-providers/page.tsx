              Article 13 of the European Accessibility Act outlines the
              obligations of service providers. Service providers are any
              natural or legal person who provides a service, as defined in the
              Directive, that falls within the scope of the Act.
            </p>
            <p>
              Service providers have a direct responsibility to ensure that
              their services are designed and provided in accordance with the
              accessibility requirements of this Directive. This includes
              digital services, e-commerce, banking services, transportation,
