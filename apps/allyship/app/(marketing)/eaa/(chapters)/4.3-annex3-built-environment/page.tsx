              Annex III of the European Accessibility Act establishes
              accessibility requirements for the built environment where
              services covered by the EAA are provided to the public. These
              requirements aim to ensure that the physical spaces where services
              are delivered are accessible to persons with disabilities,
              maximizing their foreseeable use.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's important to note that Member States can choose whether to
              require compliance with these built environment requirements. If a
              Member State decides to require compliance, the built environment
              where the service is provided must conform to the requirements
              outlined in this annex.

              Implementation of Annex III requirements may vary across Member

            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>Optional implementation:</strong> Member States decide
                whether to require compliance with the built environment
                requirements
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Varying standards:</strong> Member States may have
                different national accessibility standards for the built
                environment
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Implementation timelines:</strong> Transition periods
                for complying with built environment requirements may vary
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scope differences:</strong> Some Member States may apply
                the requirements to a broader or narrower range of services
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Enforcement mechanisms:</strong> The approach to
                monitoring and enforcing compliance may differ between countries

            </ul>
            <p>
              Service providers operating across multiple Member States should
              be aware of these variations and ensure compliance with the
              specific requirements in each country where they operate.

            Relationship with Other Annexes

            <p>Annex III works in conjunction with other parts of the EAA:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>Annex I (Accessibility Requirements):</strong> While
                Annex I focuses on product and service accessibility, Annex III
                addresses the physical environment where those services are
                provided
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Annex II (Examples of Implementation):</strong> Some
                examples in Annex II may relate to physical interfaces or
                elements relevant to the built environment
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Annex IV and VI (Disproportionate Burden):</strong> The
                assessment of disproportionate burden may also apply to built
                environment requirements
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Annex V (Conformity Assessment):</strong> The conformity
                assessment process may need to consider built environment
                aspects for service providers
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Understanding the interrelation between these annexes helps
              service providers develop comprehensive accessibility strategies
              that address both digital and physical aspects of service
              delivery.
