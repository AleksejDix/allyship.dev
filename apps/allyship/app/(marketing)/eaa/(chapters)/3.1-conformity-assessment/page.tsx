            Purpose of Conformity Assessment

          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p>
              Conformity assessment is the process by which manufacturers and
              service providers verify that their products and services comply
              with the accessibility requirements of the European Accessibility
              Act (EAA). It is a critical step in ensuring that products and
              services placed on the EU market are accessible to persons with
              disabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              The conformity assessment procedure provides a systematic approach
              to evaluating accessibility and demonstrating compliance with the
              legal requirements, giving both economic operators and market
              surveillance authorities confidence in the accessibility of
              products and services.

            <p>
              For products, the conformity assessment is based on internal
              production control, as described in Module A of Annex II to
              Decision No 768/2008/EC. This procedure consists of three key

                product's conformity with the relevant accessibility
                requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Manufacturing process:</strong> The manufacturer must
                take all measures necessary to ensure that the manufacturing
                process and its monitoring ensure that the manufactured products
                comply with the technical documentation and with the applicable
                accessibility requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>CE marking and declaration:</strong> The manufacturer
                must affix the CE marking to each individual product that meets
                the applicable requirements and draw up a written EU declaration
                of conformity.
