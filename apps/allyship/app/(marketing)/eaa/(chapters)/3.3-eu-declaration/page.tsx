              The EU Declaration of Conformity (DoC) is a legally binding
              document that officially states that a product meets all
              accessibility requirements of the European Accessibility Act (EAA)
              and other relevant EU legislation. This document represents the
              formal statement of responsibility by the manufacturer or service

              The responsibility for drawing up the EU Declaration of Conformity

              By drawing up the EU Declaration of Conformity, economic operators
              assume full responsibility for the compliance of their products

              of non-compliance.

              not required to issue a formal EU Declaration of Conformity as
              defined in the EAA.

                where the product is placed on the market
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Standard model:</strong> Where possible, follow the

                (such as Annex III to Decision No 768/2008/EC)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Single document:</strong> The declaration should be a

                legislations
              </li>

                <strong>Document identification:</strong> Include a unique

              In some cases, a simplified EU Declaration of Conformity may be
              used under the EAA:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>When allowed:</strong> A simplified declaration can be
                used where the full declaration would be overly complex or would
                need to accompany each individual product
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Required content:</strong> The simplified declaration
                must contain:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                  <li>
                    Standard statement of compliance with Directive (EU)

                  </li>
                  <li>

              <li>
                <strong>Accessibility:</strong> The full declaration must be

              The simplified declaration is particularly useful for products

                <strong>Penalties for non-compliance:</strong> Providing a false
                or incomplete declaration may result in:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
                  <li>Administrative penalties</li>
                  <li>Market withdrawal orders</li>
                  <li>Financial penalties</li>
                  <li>Criminal liability in serious cases</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Given these implications, economic operators should ensure that
              their products genuinely comply with all requirements before
              issuing a Declaration of Conformity.
