            <p>
              Annex V of the European Accessibility Act (EAA) establishes the
              procedures for assessing whether products comply with the
              applicable accessibility requirements. This annex outlines two
              conformity assessment modules that manufacturers can use: internal
              production control (Module A) and EU-type examination followed by
              conformity to type (Modules B and C).
            </p>
            <p>
              The conformity assessment process is a critical step that
              manufacturers must complete before placing products on the EU
              market. It ensures that products meet the accessibility
              requirements specified in Annex I of the EAA and serves as the
              basis for the EU Declaration of Conformity and CE marking.

            <p>
              Internal production control (Module A) is the simplest conformity
              assessment procedure, where the manufacturer takes full
              responsibility for ensuring and declaring that the products
              concerned satisfy the applicable requirements.

            <ol className="pl-6 space-y-4">
              <li>
                <strong>Technical Documentation:</strong> The manufacturer must
                establish technical documentation that enables assessment of the
                product's conformity with the relevant accessibility
                requirements. The documentation must specify:
                <ul>

                <strong>Manufacturing Process Controls:</strong> The
                manufacturer must take all measures necessary to ensure that the
                manufacturing process and its monitoring ensure compliance of
                the manufactured products with:
                <ul>
                  <li>

              EU-type examination (Module B) is the part of a conformity
              assessment procedure in which a notified body examines the

              Factors to Consider
            </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Product Complexity:</strong> More complex products with
                numerous accessibility features may benefit from the greater
                scrutiny provided by EU-type examination.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Market Risk:</strong> Products where accessibility
                failures could significantly impact users or lead to higher
                liability might warrant external verification through Modules B
                and C.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Manufacturer Experience:</strong> Companies with limited
                experience in accessibility implementation might gain confidence
                and reduce risk by using external notified bodies.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Available Standards:</strong> Where harmonized standards
                fully cover the product, internal production control may be
                sufficient; where gaps exist, external verification provides
                additional assurance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Business Considerations:</strong> While Module A
                (internal production control) is typically faster and less
                costly, Modules B and C may provide market advantages through
                third-party verification.
              </li>
