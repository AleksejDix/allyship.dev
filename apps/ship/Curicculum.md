Modular Curriculum Structure
----------------------------### Module Design Principles

1.  Self-Contained : Each module stands alone, with no dependency on others unless explicitly stated.
2.  Practical Focus : Includes hands-on exercises, real-world projects, and tools.
3.  Scalable Learning : Modules progress from foundational to advanced topics.
4.  Interdisciplinary Approach : Combines technical skills, theory, and practical application.
